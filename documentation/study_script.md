Study Script
============

1. Greeting the participant
	+ Greeting and Proposition
		* Hello, how are you?
		* Thank you for agreeing to participate.
		* I need to test my website’s design for usability.
		* You just need to click around the website to accomplish tasks for my checklist, while I ask for your opinion.
		* It will take 5 to 10 min at most.
	+ Preliminary Interview
    	* This is the background info you will need for this study:
		* For UI, I designed a website for an online store.
		* We are testing the website, not you
		* This is to test how intuitive, useful and efficient the design is.
		* Please feel free to voice your opinion of the design and features.
	+ Warm up questions
		* We would like to find out a little about you before you begin
		* Have you ever used shopped online before? If so, for how long?
		* How old are you?
		* Do you use the mobile version of an online store if ever?
		* Do you prefer using sites on your phone or a computer?
		* If you had to choose, would you rather shop online or shop in an actual store?
		* On a scale from 1-10 how comfortable are you shopping online?
		* Thank you for answering those questions
		* For testing purposes, we’d like to record your age and major. Do you mind giving me that info?
			- How old are you?
			- What is your major?
		* Thank you. Now we can begin testing the site.

2. Testing portion: Providing Instructions
	+ These are the instructions for you to follow:
		* Please type this into the URL: www.zeroshop.ga
		* Starting now, I’m going to give you tasks to accomplish on this site.
		* There is no right or wrong way of completing the tasks. Some have multiple ways of completion. We are testing which method is more intuitive for users.
		* Please think out loud so I can hear your thought process for each task.
		* If you are ever confused, just ask me and I will try to answer any concerns/questions if it does not conflict with the study.
		* Your opinion is very valuable so do not hesitate to share your input.
		* After completing one task, I will give you another until the study is complete.
		* Do you have any questions?
	+ Orient the participant to the screen objects and test elements (but not too much! Remember you may want to test learnability. First impressions are important.)
	+ Conduct the test:
		* Register for an account
		* Log out
		* Log back in
		* View your cart (should be empty)
		* Go back to the home page
		* Go to the full products list
		* Open an items product view (This view should hold the description and an option to purchase)
		* Change the quantity of items to buy (can be any number)
		* Add the item to your cart
		* Find the featured “items”
		* Add a featured item to your cart.
		* Go to your cart and check out.
