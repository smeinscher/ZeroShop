Study Design
============

Purpose
-------

The purpose of this study is to gauge the intuitiveness of the ZeroShop user interface. The user interface and user experience must accomidate customers in finding and purchising items from the ZeroShop website. Design that makes these tasks difficult or confusing needs to be changed to better accommodate stakeholders.

We expect the results from this study to help us improve the ZeroShop interface. Currently the user interface is on its second iteration with basic functionality and provisional graphic design. Users will be asked to complete a series of tasks involving the interface and functions of the site and interviewed about thier expeirence to gauge intuitivness, ease of use, and usefulness.

The overall design of the interface is still highly fluid and radical changes to both the look-and-feel and layout of the interface can still be made, if nessisary.
