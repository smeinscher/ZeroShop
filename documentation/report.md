Identify Problems:
------------------

a.	When clicking on “products” user didn’t get the number of items displayed of the screen.
Error of omission:  User could still see all the products, but there was lack of information. (Low severity)
    
b.	User expected website to show product image from multiple angles after clicking on product to see it description.
Error of omission: User can still add product to the cart, but wanted more information on product. (Low severity)

c.	User got the error “Please login or sign up to use cart”. User didn’t know they have to login or signup in order to add product to the cart.
Error of commission:  User had to go back and signup to use the cart. (medium severity)

d.	User didn’t get the option to clear whole cart.
Error of omission:  User clicked “Remove from cart” on each individual item to remove them for cart. (High severity)

e.	User clicked on logout instead of cart.
Error of commission: User had to login again to check the cart. (Low severity)

Prioritize Problems:
--------------------

Highest to lowest priority

1.	\(d\) Clear cart option 
2.	\(g\) “Submit” button issue.
3.	\(f\) “Add to cart” button redirect to product main page.
4.	\(c\) login or signup before adding items to cart
5.	\(a\) user doesn’t know how many products are displayed on screen
6.	\(b\) User wanted to see more information on product including more (images).
7.	\(e\) Logout button issue.

Theorized Reasons:
------------------

1.	\(a\) We believe its user preference issue. User wanted product page information to be displayed a certain way. User expected to see the number of products displayed on the page.

2.	\(b\) This is another user preference issue. User expected to see more images of product when clicked on product. 

3.	\(c\) We didn’t convey the information properly. User believed they can order items as a guest and therefore didn’t try to sign up before adding items to the cart. 

4.	\(d\) This was the oversight on our part during the creation of the website. We wanted to add the clear whole cart button but got around to doing it during implementation phase. 

5.	\(e\) This was a user error. Because the cart and logout button are very close to each other the user clicked on logout button instead of cart button. User probably couldn’t tell they clicked on the wrong button until it was too late. 

6.	\(f\) This is another oversight on our part during the implementation of the website.  User expected to stay on the same page or return to previous page but instead got redirected to the products main page.

7.	\(g\) This was oversight on our part. User forgot to add full information on checkout screen before clicking “Submit” button and didn’t get the warning about incomplete info. 

Theorize Solutions:
-------------------

a.	This problem can easily be solved by adding the count of number of product displayed on screen on top and bottom.

b.	This problem can be solved by adding multiple images of the product on product description page.

c.	There are multiple ways we can solve the problem. We can display a message on main page about signing up or login to add products to the cart or we don’t let user to browse product page until the login or signup. 

d.	We can add the clear cart button to clear the whole cart so users don’t need to remove one items at a time if they want to clear the while cart. 

e.	We believe the best was to solve this problem is add a “Are you sure you want to logout” message when user clicks logout button.  

f.	To solve this problem we can make it so that if user clicked “add to cart” button user stay on the same page.

g.	This problem can be solved by giving user error message if user has put incomplete information 
on checkout page.
